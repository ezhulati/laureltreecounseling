        <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">6. Telehealth Limitations and Risks</h2>
        <p class="text-text-secondary">
          While telehealth provides many benefits, you should understand its limitations:

        <ul class="text-text-secondary">
          <li>Technology failures or interruptions may occur</li>

          <li>Not appropriate for emergency mental health crises</li>
          <li>Insurance coverage may differ from in-person services</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-text-secondary">

        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">7. Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
