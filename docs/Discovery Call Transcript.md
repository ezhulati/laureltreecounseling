Me: Hey, Kristen. I'm doing well. How are you?  
Them: Hi, Henry. How are you? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. So sorry. Was running a little behind there.  
Me: No worries. Glad we, got a chance to connect.  
Them: Yeah. So did you see my email that I did send back to you just about what I was looking for and  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So  
Them: so  
Me: was reading through it. I had I had a few more questions for you I wanted to ask.  
Them: Yeah. Okay.  
Me: So said you wanted to grow. Are you at capacity right now, or or do you have openings?  
Them: We do have some openings. But sometimes we are functioning at capacity. And my goal is that I would like to bring on another clinician. But I'm feeling a little bit shaky in that area because I'm, like, okay. I'm right there. If I bring them on, then I'm worried about filling up their schedule. Because maybe they might want 30 clients I'm feeling like I'm growing. Michelle and I are very full. I have a dietician also that I just added to the practice. And, like, literally just added. So I just did the announcement last week. And I would like to also promote her services. People don't have to be in therapy with Michelle and I in order to access the dietitian, and then I felt like this adds a new layer to things in terms of marketing and, like, making sure that people know that Megan is available for meetings and appointments. So how do I do that as well?  
Me: Okay. You you mentioned some you know, some something about experience in the phone. You just not a user friendly experience in the phone. What what's happening right now with that?  
Them: The website is okay. It it seems like it's working, but sometimes I feel like it's just, like, distorts pictures a little bit.  
Me: Oh, I meant I meant a phone.  
Them: And I would just  
Me: You said something about the phone like, your phone calls aren't the the phone call experience is not helpful.  
Them: Oh, no. The phone call experience is okay. It's just more so, like, when you're going on my website on the phone. I just feel like it looks a little bit distorted, and I'm just I want it to be  
Me: Okay. Okay. Okay. I gotcha. Okay. Cool.  
Them: yeah.  
Me: I mean, the site itself is a single page. Right? It's just like a homepage. There's not much to it.  
Them: There is, like, a I think there is a little spot where you can say, like, I don't know if it's an about me page or something. Like, where you can click down, and then it opens up something else.  
Me: Okay. Let me show you what I was looking at. And it's loyal frequent counseling not to be confused with laurel tree counseling and therapy. Right? I think there's another one that very similar to you I found the other.  
Them: Yeah. There's very yeah. I learned there's somebody else who's very similar to myself.  
Me: Okay. So this is your website, and I I think,  
Them: Yeah. That's me.  
Me: I think there are some links up here. I just can't see it because it's, like, red on white maybe. But unnoble, I think, shows up. Yeah. So that's  
Them: Interesting.  
Me: it's just not visible on desktop. Which is fine. But, I mean, that's easily fixed support. Not a big deal. I just wanted to point that out to you. Okay. So simple practice integration Is that just this button right here?  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Okay. So that's pretty basic too. Right? I mean, that's is this flow what you like right now? Or do you wanna change it?  
Them: So when you say flow, like, clicking a button and bringing them to this,  
Me: Like, is working. There's nothing you really wanna change about, you know, how this works.  
Them: how much can be changed really because, there's basically just, like, a widget that you get  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: from the company, and then you just have to embed it, and then that like, that's it.  
Me: Okay. Cool. So you don't there's nothing there that you want to to change about that. Because you really can't  
Them: Yeah. I don't think you can.  
Me: Okay. Then you mentioned marketing materials for referrals. How does that work? Where are you getting referrals from?  
Them: So I also work for, a major house system in Michigan, and so a lot of patients find me because they have a relationship with me from the hospital, but I also have a lot of physician relationships, people who are in private practice and things like that. And so, what I had done in the past was just going and dropping off, like, business cards and just, like, little cards about what's happening. But I think I would like to make it a little bit more digital friendly. So, the dietitian, when she came on, she said what she does is, previously, she was making some type of, like, a referral slip that was digital. That she would then email to the physicians and then they would be able to access that And it was just I don't really know that much about digital marketing in terms of how I could use that to help with referrals just to make it easy for them, like, click click. I added this to your chart. Go see this therapist like that.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: That would be amazing.  
Me: And then social media, is that, like, don't have a presence because it you just didn't think it would add value or you just don't have time for it.  
Them: Time.  
Me: Or because social media Yeah. It's just time. So you just need someone to be able to handle  
Them: Yeah. Basically, I work full time for the hospital, and then I have a almost a full time private practice job, and I do a ton of admin. I do have a billing company. But yeah.  
Me: k. So  
Them: A lot of that is me. So my job is eventually going to hopefully close at the hospital. I would like to just move into private practice, but I wanna make sure it's gonna very, very sustainable in order for me to make that jump.  
Me: K. It's o is everything telehealth? Is it all over video?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Okay. So then is local important? Like, do you want to rank for people that search you know, bariatric counselor near me or in this city. Is that important since it's all telehealth  
Them: So right now, we're regulated well, we're relegated to Michigan. Michigan is one of the only states that didn't sign the SIPACT, which is allowing us to go across state borders. So but I would like to be reachable to all areas of Michigan. I mean, I could be marketing myself to patients in the UP who feel like they have limited access to care and would like to meet with somebody. Absolutely. Could serve them. And yeah. So I was noticing, like, I'm part of something called psychologytoday.com, which is just, like, advertising for therapists. You're might be familiar. And, what I was noticing, and I don't know how to totally utilize this, but another gal that I know of that has a private practice, when I went into her psychology today, she had, like, 10 listings. She herself lives in Birmingham, but she was listed in Ferndale, Southfield, Royal Oak, Ann Arbor, Traverse City, Petoskey. Like, she's kinda branching this out. And I'm like, how do I even I just I feel digitally limited. I'm like, I don't have the bandwidth or the time to, like, figure out how like, market myself all over the state, but, like, I I would love to because if I could grow the practice and support, multiple therapists, I would love to be able to do that.  
Me: Yeah. So one thing that works really well I recently worked with an ABA therapy business here in Texas. And  
Them: I did actually see this.  
Me: yeah, and what what we did here was, I added city pages  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: for each of the cities in Texas where they want to serve to have to to provide service. And so if someone is in Serena, And they type in a be a therapy in. This page will rank on Google. And they'll be able to land here so we could do something similar to this. This works really well with search.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: So it would be, like, you know, the types of therapy you provide in a city. And and it sounds like it'll be an  
Them: Uh-huh.  
Me: around Michigan. In the in the Michigan area. So that that was really well. I I didn't know if you were limited to geography or not since it was all telehealth. It sounds like you're limited to the state, at least the the Michigan state. Okay.  
Them: Unless I ended up bringing in a clinician who did have licensure and  
Me: I gotcha.  
Them: other states, which sometimes you run into that,  
Me: Yep.  
Them: But as of right now, I don't have that. I do like that little bar also where I was talking about the different insurance plans.  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: Something that I think is a little bit confusing in terms of marketing, which insurances you take is you might say, like, oh, I I take Blue Cross Blue Shield or I take UnitedHealthcare. But there's all of these planned caveats So and I think sometimes people aren't sure whether or not you take an insurance. So, like, I like, I myself personally I take Cigna insurance. But I didn't realize Cigna is connected to Priority Health. Down the line. And so I worked for the hospital, Arming, insurance, all my hospital employees, is priority health. And so a lot of patients I have contact with, but I'm not advertising right now that I take  
Me: I got you.  
Them: priority health. Like, I don't even know all of the umbrellas that it might be touching. And so, like, at a bar like that, where it could list  
Me: Yep.  
Them: all the things that you do accept and allow patients to have  
Me: You you probably need to hold  
Them: that.  
Me: a whole page dedicated to that. Like, insurance, we accept.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You know, so patients can go can go right to it, they can see all that. So, yeah, I mean, look, you know, I can I can definitely help with I think, a lot of what you described? I think the last thing is, like, budget. How much have we planned to allocate towards this this exercise? Like, if it were to do a whole new website, and just, you know, completely re redo it from scratch. Social media probably not something I would take on right now, just because I'm just super busy, and social media just takes it takes a lot of time because you have to get creative creatives going and and things like that. But I can definitely help you redo the website. I think you need a new website. I think that's it. That should be, like, your your first priority. And then after that, I would say probably let local business. Are you showing up on Google locally at all? Could I Google my biz  
Them: No. I haven't even gotten to that yet.  
Me: Yeah. I think that would be huge because that's typically what shows up on top of search. People are searching like services. Services near me, things like that. So that that would probably be my second priority. But what what what type of budget do you have in mind for for the project? Just for, you know, for the marketing  
Them: To be honest, I feel kinda sheltered from that. I'm not sure, like, what even budget. I know I have some funds available. I I don't know what that would cost. Like, if it's something you could kinda  
Me: Yeah. Okay.  
Them: say over this sort of a timeline, this is what we could accomplish or, like, I I don't know.  
Me: Let me put together, like, a you know, a quote in the package for you and, like, really explain in detail like, what I think we, you know, you should do and how much it would cost, and I'll send that over to you. And then, you know, we can go from there and see if that works or not.  
Them: That'd be awesome. Yeah. I would love to know just and I found you actually because I was searching for something, and I ended up  
Me: I was curious I was curious how you found me because  
Them: I landed Actually, I was on another  
Me: I'm a I'm a go on social support.  
Them: I can't remember. It was on another web designer's page that was local because I was looking for somebody. And then it led me to that page with the penguin, the ABA therapy.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Okay.  
Them: And I was like, oh, but it wasn't listing them as the current owner of that page. And I'm like, I want somebody who's in medical or who's done some type of therapy. Then I went to that company independently, and then I found your name at the bottom  
Me: I see. Yes. So that's  
Them: So I was like, oh, I really like that site. And, like, where is this guy? My brother lives down in Dallas. And I'm like,  
Me: that's my that's my thing that we're down there.  
Them: well,  
Me: Okay. Okay.  
Them: Interesting. Okay. So  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I want I've you know, I I have a very deep medical device to  
Them: Yeah. Mhmm.  
Me: history. I spent almost fifteen years in in the medical device world, I know health care really well. And then  
Them: Yeah. That also really excited me.  
Me: Yeah. And in 2017, I kinda made the the jump to digital, because the front of mine actually had another engineer I to work with started a website, comparepower.com, which is a purchasing shopping site here in Texas. It just blew like it took off. And so I joined him, and I've been literally building websites and just doing digital marketing for the last, like, ten years. So, yeah, when you email me, I was like, this is wonder what you found me because, like, this is right off my alley. I can definitely help you out. But that's an interesting story from how you how you got to me.  
Them: It was an interesting pathway. So I was like, oh, that's not her. Right? What is this?  
Me: Cool. Okay. Yeah. And and then I was like, if she she because I'm dialing, so, it's it's someone recommended her to me. She and Dallas, and I studied one in Dallas. Or Michigan because I stayed in area code. So anyway, cool. Well, let me I'll show up with the room now, and you know, if you feel like that's it looks good, that's the right approach, And if not, just shoot me a note and say, hey. What about what about this? What about that?  
Them: Okay.  
Me: I'll try to give you some different options on, like, you know, the bone minimum we should do, you know, a little ground and, like, roll out. And then we'll go from there.  
Them: That'd be great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.  
Me: Alright. We'll speak soon.  
Them: Okay. Thanks, honey. Thank you. Bye.
